# Climate
## Jupyter
At the start, an engine was made for the SQLite file in the resources folder. Once the database was reflected a reference was made to each of the tables inside. This allowed me to begin the session to start querying. I first got the latest date which I used to create a query of the last 12 months of the date and precipitation from the measurement database. This was made into a data frame and I converted the Date column into a DateTime type to better fit the graph. I then made a bar graph of that data which shows how much rain happened and saw that most of the time the rain rarely goes above 1 or 2 inches. Afterward through another query, I found the minimum, maximum, and average temperature of the most active station using the same database. Next, I made a data frame from a query of the last 12 months of only the TOBs to make a histogram. With this, we can see that the temperature is most frequently around 70-80 which appears correct from our average of 71.67 that I found.
## App
Next, I made a climate app that will have multiple API routes. For the precipitation route, a JSON of the date and precipitation is given from the databases. The station's route gives a JSON of station ids and station names. The tobsâ€™ route gives a JSON of date and tob. The last two routes ask for a time range for both start and end depending on the route which it will use to create a JSON of the minimum, maximum, and average temperature of the given range.
